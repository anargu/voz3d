Worldwide 2 to 4 people per 1000 have partial or total loss of hearing. In Peru, around 10% of newborns are at risk of losing their hearing.

Voz3D is a project designed to facilitate communication with people with hearing disabilities, consists of a voice translator to Peruvian Sign Language, by using the microphone of the device the words are received and converted into text and using a 3D avatar this plays an animation according to the spoken word. Since it starts with the voice ("Voz") and ends in a 3D session, we named it Voz3D

Was developed as a web-app so that it can be used in different environments we can find uses of this application in customer service, commissariats, hospitals and schools, environments that are not adapted for people with hearing disabilities.
